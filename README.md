# MLDL

This is the official implementation of our project on Semantic Segmentation. The code was organized into folders, for each step. 
Each folder contains the 'datasets_custom' folder with the python files used to create the training and test datasets used in the main code. In every folder there is also a 'models' folder with the python implementation of the architectures used. 
For each step a jupiter notebook containing the training and validation pipeline was created, along with its training file and utils file.
